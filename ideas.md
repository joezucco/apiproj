# React Project

Trying to work through some ideas for the app. I plan on including structure / planning in this markdown as well.

## Rough Ideas

- Moon phase API
- Tide / Currents API
- Abient music API - use Bandcamp or Spotify API to pull music tagged as ambient and randomly generate. "Study Music"
- Use Mixcloud's API ?!
- Concerts near you
- Music producers API

-Easy APIs
-Weather

-Trefle plant API
-Forget Me Not / Plantbase



## Next Steps
- Add donate to ASPCA button
- Fix about page positioning/flexbox
